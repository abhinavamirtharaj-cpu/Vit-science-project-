DEVICE-TO-DEVICE COMMUNICATION GUIDE
====================================

This guide explains how to set up and run the 2-device communication demo using this project, with each device running on a separate machine or environment.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Python 3.8+
- All dependencies installed (see requirements.txt)
- Network connectivity between both devices (same LAN or accessible IP)

SETUP STEPS
-----------
1. Install dependencies on both devices:
   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
   (Or use pip install -r requirements.txt if requirements.txt is in the root.)

2. On Device 1 (Server):
   a. Start the Flask server:
      python3 run.py
   b. By default, the server runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   c. To allow connections from another device, run:
      python3 run.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
   d. Note your device's IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

3. On Device 2 (Client):
   a. Open or modify the client script or UI to point to Device 1's IP:
      - If using a browser, go to: http://<Device1-IP>:5000
      - If using a script, set the API endpoint to http://<Device1-IP>:5000
   b. Example API call from Device 2:
      curl -X POST http://<Device1-IP>:5000/api/analyze \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"text": "Hello from Device 2!", "contact_id": "dev2", "contact_name": "Device 2"}'

4. Chat/Comms Flow:
   - Device 2 sends messages to Device 1's server via the API or UI.
   - Device 1 processes, stores, and analyzes the messages.
   - Both devices can view chat history and sentiment analysis via the web UI or API.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- Ensure both devices are on the same network or that firewalls allow port 5000.
- Use the correct IP address for Device 1.
- If you get connection errors, check that the Flask server is running and accessible from Device 2.
- For advanced setups (e.g., HTTPS, custom ports), modify run.py and firewall settings accordingly.

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW
----------------
1. Device 1: python3 run.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
2. Device 2: In browser, visit http://<Device1-IP>:5000 or use curl/postman to send API requests.
3. Both devices can interact via the chat interface or API endpoints.
