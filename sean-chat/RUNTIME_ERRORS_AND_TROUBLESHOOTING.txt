RUNTIME ERRORS & TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
=====================================

This file explains what runtime errors are, the types you might encounter, and common things that can go wrong when running the files in this project.

-------------------------------------
WHAT IS A RUNTIME ERROR?
-------------------------------------
A runtime error is a problem that happens while your program is running. Unlike syntax errors (which stop your code from starting), runtime errors only show up when you try to use the program.

-------------------------------------
COMMON TYPES OF RUNTIME ERRORS
-------------------------------------
1. **ImportError / ModuleNotFoundError**
   - Happens when Python can't find a package or module you are trying to use.
   - Example: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`
   - Fix: Install missing package with `pip install flask`.

2. **FileNotFoundError**
   - Happens when your code tries to open a file that doesn't exist.
   - Example: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'train.csv'`
   - Fix: Make sure the file exists in the correct folder.

3. **TypeError**
   - Happens when you use the wrong type of data (like adding a number to a string).
   - Example: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'`
   - Fix: Check your code to make sure you are using the right types.

4. **ValueError**
   - Happens when a function gets a value it can't handle.
   - Example: `ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'abc'`
   - Fix: Make sure your data is in the correct format.

5. **ConnectionError / URLError**
   - Happens when your code tries to connect to a server or network and fails.
   - Example: `URLError(ConnectionRefusedError(111, 'Connection refused'))`
   - Fix: Check your network, server address, and firewall settings.

6. **KeyError / IndexError**
   - Happens when you try to access a dictionary key or list index that doesn't exist.
   - Example: `KeyError: 'name'` or `IndexError: list index out of range`
   - Fix: Make sure the key or index exists before using it.

-------------------------------------
THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG
-------------------------------------
- **Missing dependencies:** Not all required Python packages are installed.
- **Missing files:** Data files like CSVs are not present or are in the wrong folder.
- **Wrong Python version:** Some code may require a specific version of Python.
- **Network issues:** Server/client programs may not connect if on different networks or blocked by firewalls.
- **Permission errors:** You may not have permission to read/write files.
- **Incorrect file paths:** Code may look for files in the wrong location.
- **Syntax errors:** Typos or mistakes in code can prevent it from running.
- **Logic errors:** The code runs but does not do what you expect (harder to spot).

-------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
-------------------------------------
- Read the error message carefully; it often tells you what went wrong.
- Check that all required files and packages are present.
- Make sure you are in the correct folder when running commands.
- If you get a network error, check your connection and server address.
- Search online for the error message if you don't understand it.
- Ask for help if you are stuck—everyone runs into errors sometimes!

-------------------------------------
GLOSSARY
-------------------------------------
- **Runtime Error:** Problem that happens while the program is running.
- **Syntax Error:** Problem that stops the program from starting (usually a typo).
- **Dependency:** Extra code or package your program needs to work.
- **Network:** How computers connect and talk to each other.
- **Server/Client:** Server waits for messages, client sends messages.

-------------------------------------
If you see an error, don't worry! Errors are a normal part of coding. Use this guide to help fix them.
